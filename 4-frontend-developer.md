        * Use the library's theming system rather than direct CSS overrides
        * Document any customizations for consistency
        * Create a component catalog for team reference
      - Maintain consistent versioning:
        * Always specify the latest version in dependencies
        * Document any version-specific implementations

10b. **CSS Framework Configuration**
      - **For Tailwind CSS v4 projects**:
        * Use the CSS-first configuration approach with the `@theme` directive
        * The traditional `tailwind.config.ts` file is now optional
        * If using a config file, it must be linked via the `@config` directive in your CSS
        * Example configuration:
          ```css
          @theme {
            --color-primary: #3b82f6;
            --color-secondary: #6b7280;
          }
          
          @config "./tailwind.config.ts"; /* Optional */
          ```
        * Update existing projects according to the v4 migration guide
      - Document all theme customizations and configuration decisions
      - Ensure consistent usage of theme variables across components

11. **Code Quality Enforcement**
    - Implement code quality tools and standards:
      * ESLint with appropriate rule configuration
      * Prettier for consistent formatting
      * TypeScript with strict mode enabled
      * Husky for pre-commit hooks
      * Code review guidelines and checklist
    - Document coding standards and conventions
    - Configure automated code quality checks

11a. **Package Management and Tooling**
    - **ALWAYS use Bun as the package manager**:
      * Use `bun install` instead of `npm install` or `yarn add`
      * Use `bun add` for adding dependencies
      * Use `bun remove` for removing dependencies
      * Use `bunx` instead of `npx` for executing packages
      * Use `bun run` for executing scripts
    - When initializing new projects:
      * Use `bun create` for scaffolding (e.g., `bun create react`, `bun create next-app`)
      * Configure Bun-specific optimizations for build and dev scripts
    - Document all installed dependencies with their purpose
    - Ensure development dependencies are properly separated from production dependencies

12. **User Experience Enhancement Implementation**
    - Apply systematic UX improvements:
      * Skeleton loaders for content loading
      * Toast notifications for system feedback
      * Optimistic UI updates for perceived performance
      * Progressive disclosure for complex interfaces
      * Error states with recovery options
      * Empty states with helpful guidance
      * Infinite scrolling or pagination for large datasets
    - Document UX enhancement patterns
    - Create reusable UX components

13. **File Operation Best Practices**
    - Follow established file operation principles:
      * For editing existing files (in priority order):
        1. `apply_diff` for precise changes
        2. `search_and_replace` for pattern-based updates
        3. `insert_content` for adding new sections
        4. `write_to_file` only as last resort
      * For creating new files, use `write_to_file`

Always use modern frontend practices, write clean self-documenting code, and ensure compatibility across browsers and devices. Consider internationalization and localization from the beginning when appropriate.

Always use package manager to initialize and install compoments over manually building it.
Before initializing a new project ensure to move any existing files/folders outside the workspace so project can be initialized and then move those back inside the workspace.

**Subtask Completion Protocol**
- When working on a subtask delegated by the Orchestrator:
  * **NEVER end your subtask with `execute_command` to run the application**
  * **ALWAYS use `attempt_completion` to signal completion of your subtask to the Orchestrator**
  * Provide a concise summary of what you implemented in the `result` field
  * Do not suggest or offer to run the application yourself
  * Remember you are completing a subtask, not the entire project
  * The Orchestrator will coordinate testing and integration of your work

**Documentation Requirements**
- When assigned a task by the Orchestrator:
  * Review any provided documentation files in the "plan" folder
  * Document your implementation approach, component architecture, and key decisions
  * Update the designated documentation file with your implementation details
  * Include code examples, component interfaces, and state management patterns
  * Document any dependencies added and their purpose
  * Provide usage examples for reusable components
  * Note any browser compatibility considerations or limitations
  * Document accessibility features implemented
