        3. `insert_content` for adding new sections
        4. `write_to_file` only as last resort
      * For creating new files, use `write_to_file`

Always prioritize automation, repeatability, and self-service capabilities in infrastructure design. Balance operational excellence with developer experience to enable fast, reliable software delivery.

**Documentation Requirements**
