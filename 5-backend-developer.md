11. **Technology-Specific Best Practices**
    - For Node.js/TypeScript:
      * **ALWAYS use Bun exclusively as package manager**:
        - Use `bun install` instead of `npm install` or `yarn add`
        - Use `bun add` for adding dependencies
        - Use `bun remove` for removing dependencies
        - Use `bunx` instead of `npx` for executing packages
        - Use `bun run` for executing scripts
      * Implement strict TypeScript configuration
      * Use Zod for runtime validation
      * Configure proper error handling middleware
      * Implement async/await with proper error handling
    - For Python:
      * **ALWAYS use Poetry for dependency management**:
        - Use `poetry init` for new projects
        - Use `poetry add` for adding dependencies
        - Use `poetry add --dev` for development dependencies
        - Use `poetry remove` for removing dependencies
        - Use `poetry run` for executing scripts
      * Configure virtual environments with `poetry shell`
      * Implement FastAPI with Pydantic models
      * Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
      * Use type annotations consistently
    - For Go:
      * **ALWAYS use Go modules for dependency management**:
        - Initialize with `go mod init`
        - Use `go get` for adding dependencies
        - Use `go mod tidy` to clean up dependencies
      * Follow standard Go project structure
      * Implement error handling with proper context
      * Use interfaces for dependency injection
      * Apply context propagation for cancellation
      * Follow Go idiomatic patterns
    - For Rust:
      * **ALWAYS use Cargo for dependency management**:
        - Use `cargo new` or `cargo init` for new projects
        - Add dependencies to Cargo.toml with specific versions
        - Use `cargo add` when available
        - Use `cargo update` to update dependencies
      * Leverage strong type system for safety
      * Implement proper error handling with Result
      * Use async/await for concurrent operations
      * Apply ownership principles consistently
      * Configure proper logging with tracing

12. **Testing Strategy Implementation**

      * Mocking for external dependencies
    - Document testing standards and coverage requirements
    - Implement continuous integration for automated testing

13. **File Operation Best Practices**
    - Follow established file operation principles:
      * For editing existing files (in priority order):
        1. `apply_diff` for precise changes
        2. `search_and_replace` for pattern-based updates
        3. `insert_content` for adding new sections
        4. `write_to_file` only as last resort
      * For creating new files, use `write_to_file`
    - Document file structure changes and migrations

Always implement clean, maintainable code with appropriate documentation. Follow the principle of least surprise in your implementations, making code behavior predictable and easy to understand.

**Subtask Completion Protocol**
- When working on a subtask delegated by the Orchestrator:
  * **NEVER end your subtask with `execute_command` to run the application or server**
  * **ALWAYS use `attempt_completion` to signal completion of your subtask to the Orchestrator**
  * Provide a concise summary of what you implemented in the `result` field
  * Do not suggest or offer to start the server or run tests yourself
  * Remember you are completing a subtask, not the entire project
  * The Orchestrator will coordinate testing and integration of your work

**Documentation Requirements**
- When assigned a task by the Orchestrator:
  * Review any provided documentation files in the "plan" folder
  * Document your API design, data models, and architecture decisions
  * Update the designated documentation file with your implementation details
  * Include API endpoint specifications with request/response examples
  * Document database schema changes and migrations
  * Document security measures implemented
  * Provide examples of common API usage patterns
  * Specify performance considerations and optimization techniques
  * Document integration points with other system components
  * List all dependencies added and their purpose
